# Tree Data Structures Implementation

## Overview

This project provides implementations of two fundamental self-balancing binary search trees:

- **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.
- **Red-Black Tree**: A binary search tree with an additional property of color (red or black) assigned to each node, ensuring the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:

- `AVLTree.cpp`: Source code implementing the AVL Tree.
- `AVLTree.exe`: Executable file for the AVL Tree implementation.
- `AVLTreeHeight.txt`: Contains information about the height of the AVL Tree after various operations.
- `GenerateTest.cpp`: Source code for generating test cases to validate the tree implementations.
- `GenerateTest.exe`: Executable file for generating test cases.
- `RedBlackHeight.txt`: Contains information about the height of the Red-Black Tree after various operations.
- `RedBlackTree.cpp`: Source code implementing the Red-Black Tree.
- `RedBlackTree.exe`: Executable file for the Red-Black Tree implementation.
- `Tree`: Directory containing additional resources or related files.
- `baseValue.txt`: Contains initial values or configurations used during testing.

## Features

- **Insertion**: Add new nodes while maintaining tree balance.
- **Deletion**: Remove nodes and adjust the tree to preserve its properties.
- **Search**: Efficiently locate nodes within the tree.
- **Traversal**: In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals to access nodes in different sequences.
- **Height Calculation**: Determine the height of the tree, useful for analyzing balance and performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- Basic understanding of C++ programming and data structures.

### Compilation

To compile the source files, use the following commands:

```bash
g++ -o AVLTree AVLTree.cpp
g++ -o RedBlackTree RedBlackTree.cpp
g++ -o GenerateTest GenerateTest.cpp
```

### Execution
After compilation, run the executables:
```bash
./AVLTree
./RedBlackTree
./GenerateTest
```

### Testing
The GenerateTest program creates test cases to validate the functionality of both tree implementations. Ensure that the `baseValue.txt` file is present in the same directory as the executables, as it contains necessary initial values for testing.

## Usage

1. **Insertions and Deletions**: Use the provided functions to add or remove nodes. The trees automatically adjust to maintain their balancing properties.
2. **Search Operations**: Utilize the search functions to find specific nodes efficiently.
3. **Traversals**: Apply different traversal methods to process or display nodes in various orders.
4. **Height Analysis**: Refer to `AVLTreeHeight.txt` and `RedBlackHeight.txt` to understand how operations affect tree height and balance.

## Performance

Both AVL and Red-Black Trees offer efficient operations:

- **Search**: O(log n)
- **Insertion**: O(log n)
- **Deletion**: O(log n)

These performance characteristics make them suitable for applications requiring dynamic data sets with frequent insertions and deletions.
